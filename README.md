# Bikesharing in Des Moines

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project was to create and explore data visualizations using data of CitiBike in NYC and consider visualizations which will help its implementation in a new city: Des Moines. Using user driven data we are able to provide various analysis on gender/user breakdowns to get a better picture of where we should direct our marketing, finding peak and off hours which could lead to further optimizations in terms of device servicing and inversely having maximum supply at peak hours. 

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

First we want to look at our gender breakdown. Total there are over 2.3 million rides in the month of August. Of those, 25% were registered females and 75% were registered males. We can see there are differences in where different genders are riding. Males tend to use their trips to get farther out locations such as Jersey City and the Bronx. Inversely, most starting locations are in toursity areas such as Financial District or Midtown.

The Majority of our users are registered subscribers. We can see that the majority of rides are under 10 minutes, and males tend to set the trend because they make up the majority of trips. Females have a more even distribution of trip duration.

Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Although male and female users tend to share a pattern in terms of time of day and day of week we can see stronger patterns from Male users. 

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

We can see a lot of important piece of informations from our visualizations that will help us launch our CitiBike program in Des Moines. As seen about, our marketing efforts should be targeted more towards Male users as they use the service more on a day to day basis, take longer trips, and subscribe more often than females. This could also be a growth opportunity to females. We can see a lot of females use our service during busy rush hours in the morning and after work so we can consider marketing to female professionals who may otherwise be walking or taking a subway home. Some additional analyis we can perform would be to look at additional months than just August to see if some of the trends we find stand all year long. In addition to this, we can pull in weather data from our Weather API and compare different weather periods such as snow, sun, windy etc. and see if we see the same trends.
